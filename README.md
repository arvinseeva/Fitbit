Project Description
As a team, we believe that wellbeing is a key part of human life and growth. We intend to explore the idea of data being used to track and analyse human behaviour in terms of well-being. We will look into datasets available for public usage. We are keen to understand the idea of happiness and how that is applicable globally. We will study general areas such as economics, social, health and environmental factors.
